Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP             July 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730].  This EPP mapping
   specifies a flexible schema that can be used to implement several
   common use cases related to the provisioning and management of launch
   phase extension in a domain name registry.

   It is typical for domain registries to operate in special modes
   within certain periods of time to facilitate allocation of domain
   names for a subset of the zone namespace that becomes available.
   This document uses the term "launch phase" and the shorter form
   "launch" to refer to such a period.

   The EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731] is designed for the steady
   state operation of a registry.  During the launch, the interface used
   at each phase of the launch could be different from what is defined
   in EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731]. for example, registries
   typically accept multiple applications for a given domain name during
   the "sunrise" launch phase.  In addition, the Trademark Clearinghouse
   Draft Implementation Model [1] defines a registry interface for the
   Trademark Claims or "claims" launch phase that includes support for
   presenting a Trademark Claims Notice to the Registrant.  This
   document proposes an extension to the domain name extension in order
   to unambiguously manage the various launch phases known.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   "launch-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:launch-1.0".  The XML namespace prefix
   "launch" is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and
   instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to
   interpret and output the XML documents.


2.  Object Attributes

   This extension adds additional elements to the EPP domain name
   mapping [RFC5731].  Only those new elements are described here.

Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP             July 2012


2.1.  Application Identifiers

   Servers MAY allow multiple applications of a given domain name during
   its launch phase operations.  Upon receiving a request to create a
   domain name, the server creates an application object corresponding
   to the request and assigns an Application Identifier the application
   and returns it to the client with the <launch:applicationID> element.
   In order to facilitate correlation, all subsequent launch operations
   on the application object MUST be qualified by the previously
   assigned application identifier using the <launch:applicationID>
   element.

2.2.  Launch Phases

   The server MAY support multiple launch phases sequentially or
   simultaneously.  The <launch:phase> element MUST be included by the
   client to define the target launch phase of the command.

   The following Launch Phase values are defined:
   sunrise  Phase when trademark holders can submit registration
      applications with trademark information that can be validated by
      the server.
   landrush  Post sunrise phase when non-trademark holders are allowed
      to register domain names.
   claims  Trademark claims phase as defined by Trademark Clearinghouse
      Draft Implementation Model [1].
   open  Post launch phase that is also referred to as "steady state".
      Servers might require additional trademark protection with this
      phase.
   custom  A custom server launch phase that is defined using the "name"
      attribute.

   For extensibility the <launch:phase> element includes an OPTIONAL
   "name" attribute that can define a sub-phase or the full name of the
   phase when the <launch:phase> element has the "custom" value.

2.3.  Status Values

   A launch application object MAY have a status value.  The <status>
   element is used to convey extended status pertaining to the
   application object, beyond what is specified in the object mapping to
   which this application object represents.

   The following status values are defined:







Tan, et al.             Expires February 1, 2013                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP             July 2012


   pending:  the initial state of a newly-created application object.
   validated:  the application meets relevant registry rules.
   invalid:  the application does not validate according to registry
      rules
   allocated:  one of two possible end states of an application object;
      the object corresponding to the application has been provisioned
   rejected:  the other possible end state; the object was not
      provisioned

   Certain status values MAY be combined.  For example, an application
   can be invalid and rejected.  Additionally certain statuses MAY be
   skipped.  For example, an application can immediately start at the
   allocated status.  If a <domain:create> processes a request
   synchronously without the use of an intermediate application, than an
   Application Identifier (Section 2.1) is not needed along with the
   application status.

2.4.  Claim Validation Models

   A server MUST support one of four models for validating the claim
   information:

   code  Use of a claim code by itself to validate that the claim
      matches domain name.  The code is the "sunrise code" as defined in
      Trademark Clearinghouse Draft Implementation Model [1] that is
      validated by the server using its local sunrise code data.  This
      model is supported using the <launch:codeClaim> element with just
      the <launch:code> element.
   claim  The claim information is passed without any other validation
      element.  The server will use some custom form of validation to
      validate the claim information is authentic.  This model is
      supported using the <launch:codeClaim> element with just the
      <launch:claim> element.
   code with claim:  A code is used along with the claim information by
      the server to validate utilizing an external party like a
      Trademark Clearinghouse.  The code represents some form of secret
      that matches the claims information passed.  This model is
      supported using the <launch:codeClaim> element with both the
      <launch:code> and the <launch:claim> element.
   signed claim:  The claim information is digitally signed via the XML
      Signature [2] and can be directly validated by the server using
      the public key of the external party that created the signed
      claim.  The public key could be previously held by the server or
      could be passed in the XML Signature [2].  It's up to server
      policy how the public key is transferred.  This model is supported
      using the <launch:signedClaim> element that contains the <launch:
      claim> element with the claim information as well as the XML
      Signature and other information validated by an external party
      like a Trademark Clearinghouse.

   The <launch:claim> element supporting the different Claim Validation
   Models is defined in Claim (Section 2.5) section.  A server MAY
   support more than one claim per domain name.  More than one <launch:
   codeClaim> element or more than one <launch:signedClaim> element MAY
   be specified.  The maximum number of claims per domain name is up to
   server policy.

2.5.  Claim

   A <launch:claim> element describes an applicant's prior right to a
   given domain name.

   The child elements of the <launch:claim> element include:

Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP             July 2012


   <id>:  an identifier for the claim.  This identifier MUST be unique
      among all claims associated with an application object.
   <name>:  identifying the text string in which the applicant is
      claiming a prior right
   <issuer>:  name of the authority which issued the right (for example,
      the trademark clearinghouse, a trademark office or company
      registration bureau)
   <number>:  the registration number of the right (ie trademark number
      or company registration number)
   <type>:  indicates the type of claim being made (eg trademark,
      symbol, combined mark, company name)
   <entitlement>:  indicates the applicant's entitlement to the claim
      (ie, owner or licensee)
   <regDate>:  the date of registration of the claim
   <exDate>:  the date of expiration of the claim
   <country>:  indicates the country in which the claim is valid
   <region>:  indicates the name of a city, state, province or other
      geographic region in which the claim is valid.  This may be a two-
      character code from [WIPO.ST3]
   <owner>:  Owner information
   <contact>:  Contact for the owner
   Apart from the <name> element, all other child elements are optional.
   Server policy may place additional constraints on the format and
   requirements of such elements.


3.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].  The command
   mappings described here are specifically for use in the Launch Phase
   Extension.

   This mapping is designed to be flexible, requiring only a minimum set
   of required elements.

   While it is meant to serve several use cases, it does not prescribe
   any interpretation by the client or server.  Such processing is
   typically highly policy-dependent and therefore specific to
   implementations.

   Operations on application objects are done via one or more of the
   existing EPP verbs defined in the EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731].
   Registries may choose to support a subset of the operations.

Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP             July 2012


3.1.  EPP <check> Command

   This extension does not define any extension to the EPP <check>
   command or response described in the EPP domain name mapping
   [RFC5731].

3.2.  EPP <info> Command

   This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP <info>
   command and response to be used in conjunction with the EPP domain
   name mapping [RFC5731].

   There are two forms of the extension to the EPP <info> command that
   are dependent on the supported launch phases (Section 2.2) as defined
   below:

   sunrise  The EPP <info> command with the "sunrise" phase is used to
      retrieve information for a specific "sunrise" application based on
      an Application Identifier (Section 2.1).  This form of the EPP
      <info> extension is referred to as the Sunrise Info Form and is
      defined in the Sunrise Info Form (Section 3.2.1) section.
   landrush  The EPP <info> command with the "landrush" phase is
      undefined but the form supported is up to server policy.
   claims  The EPP <info> command with the "claims" phase is used to
      retrieve the trademark claims information associated with a non-
      existing domain name that is referred to as the Claims Info
      Command.  The response to the Claims Info Command does not extend
      the Domain Info Response as defined in EPP domain name mapping
      [RFC5731].  This form of the EPP <info> extension is referred to
      as the Claims Info Form and defined in the Claims Info Form
      (Section 3.2.2) section.
   open  The EPP <info> command with the "open" phase is undefined but
      the form supported is up to server policy.
   custom  The EPP <info> command with the "custom" phase is undefined
      but the form supported is up to server policy.

3.2.1.  Sunrise Info Form

   The Sunrise Info Form of the extension to the EPP domain name mapping
   [RFC5731] gets information on an application created with the
   <launch:create> using the Application Identifier (Section 2.1)
   returned in the <launch:creData> element.  A <launch:info> element is
   sent along with the regular <info> domain command.  The <launch:info>
   element contains the following child elements:

Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP             July 2012


   <launch:phase>  The phase during which the application was submitted
       or is associated with.  It is up to server policy what phases are
       supported for the Sunrise Info Form.
   <launch:applicationID>  the application identifier of the
       application.

   Example <info> domain command with the Sunrise Info Form <launch:
   info> extension.

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   <epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
     <command>
      <info>
       <domain:info
        xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
         <domain:name>example.tld</domain:name>
       </domain:info>
      </info>
      <extension>
       <launch:info
        xmlns:launch="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:launch-1.0">
         <launch:phase>sunrise</launch:phase>
         <launch:applicationID>abc123</launch:applicationID>
       </launch:info>
      </extension>
      <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
     </command>
   </epp>

   If the query was successful, the server replies with an <launch:
   infData> element along with the regular EPP <resData>.  The <launch:
   infData> contains the following child elements:
   <launch:phase>  the phase during which the application was submitted
       or is associated with.
   <launch:applicationID>  the application identifier of the returned
       application.
   <launch:status>  status of the application using one of the supported
       status values (Section 2.3).
   <launch:codeClaim>  zero or more <launch:codeClaim> elements or
   <launch:signedClaim>  zero or more <launch:signedClaim> elements.

   The Claim Validation Models (Section 2.4) section describes the
   <launch:codeClaim> and <launch:signedClaim> elements.

   Example <info> domain response using the Sunrise Info Form <launch:
   infData> extension with multiple codes.

3.2.2.  Claims Info Form

   The Claims Info Form of the extension to the EPP domain name mapping
   [RFC5731] gets trademark claims information for a non-existing domain
   name that is referred to as a Claims Info Command.  The <launch:info>
   element contains the following child elements:

   <launch:phase>  The phase with the value of "claims" to indicate that
       this is a Claims Info Command.

   If the query was successful, the server replies with an <launch:
   infData> element containing the trademark claims information expected
   to be used to generate the claims notice.  The <launch:infData> has
   the following child elements:

3.3.  EPP <create> Command

   There are two forms of the extension to the EPP <create> command that
   are dependent on the supported launch phases (Section 2.2) as defined
   below:

   sunrise  The EPP <create> command with the "sunrise" phase is used to
      submit an application with trademark information that can be
      verified by the server with the <domain:name> value.  The Sunrise
      Create Form (Section 3.3.1) is used for the "sunrise" phase.
      Optionally, the server can support multiple overlapping
      applications that are chosen asynchronously with a server
      generated Application Identifier (Section 2.1) for later
      reference.
   landrush  The EPP <create> command with the "landrush" phase is
      undefined but the form supported is up to server policy.
   claims  The EPP <create> command with the "claims" phase is used to
      pass the information that can be used to validate that the claims
      notice information was retrieved via the Claims Info Command and
      was accepted by the registrant.  The Claims Create Form
      (Section 3.3.2) is used for the "claims" phase.
   open  The EPP <create> command with the "open" phase is undefined but
      the form supported is up to server policy.
   custom  The EPP <create> command with the "custom" phase is undefined
      but the form supported is up to server policy.

3.3.1.  Sunrise Create Form

   The Sunrise Create Form of the extension to the EPP domain name
   mapping [RFC5731] includes the verifiable trademark information that
   the server uses to match against the domain name to authorize the
   domain create.  A server MUST support one of four models in Claim

   Validation Models (Section 2.4) for the verifiable trademark
   information passed by the client.

   A <launch:create> element is sent along with the regular <create>
   domain command.  The <launch:create> element contains the following
   child elements:

   <launch:phase>  The phase the application is associated with.
   <launch:codeClaim>  zero or more <launch:codeClaim> elements or
   <launch:signedClaim>  zero or more <launch:signedClaim> elements.

   The Claim Validation Models (Section 2.4) section describes the
   <launch:codeClaim> and <launch:signedClaim> elements.

   A <launch:create> element is sent along with the regular <create>
   domain command.  The <launch:create> element contains the following
   child elements:

   <launch:phase>  Must contain the value of "claims" to indicate it is
       the Claims Create Form
   <launch:notice> or <launch:signedNotice>
       <launch:notice>  Reference to claims notice information using a
           server generated notice identifier.  The <launch:notice>
           element has the following child elements:

           <launch:noticeID>  Server generated identifier for the claim
               notice information returned in the <launch:infData>
               element.  The server MUST validate the noticeID either
               matches the exact claims information returned in the
               <launch:infData> or the current claims information
               associated with the domain name.  The method of
               validation is up to server policy.  If the launchID does
               not pass the validation the server MUST return an EPP
               error result code of 2202.
           <launch:timestamp>  Contains the date and time that the
               claims notice was accepted
           <launch:clientAddr>  Contains the client IP address of the
               client that accepted the claims notice.
       <launch:signedNotice>  Signed claims reference information
           generated by a trusted third party like the Trademark
           Clearinghouse (TMCH).  The signature can be verified by the
           server using the trusted third party public key.  The
           <launch:signedNotice> element has the following child
           elements:

           <launch:noticeID>  Notice identifier generated by the trusted
               third party that can be used for traceability from the
               third party to the client to the server.
           <Signature>  Digital Signature over the <launch:signedNotice>
               based on the XML Signature [2] standard.  The <Transform>
               Algorithm is set to
               "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature"

Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP             July 2012


3.4.  EPP <update> Command

   This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP <update>
   command to be used in conjunction with the domain name mapping.

   A server that does not support allow multiple applications of a given
   domain name with a Application Identifier (Section 2.1) during its
   launch phase operations MUST return an EPP error result code of 2102.

   Registry policies permitting, clients may update an application
   object by submitting an EPP <update> command along with an <launch:
   update> element to indicate the application object to be updated.
   The <launch:update> element contains the following child elements:
   <launch:phase>  the phase during which the application was submitted
       or is associated with.
   <launch:applicationID>  the application identifier for which the
       client wishes to update.

   This extension does not define any extension to the response of an
   <update> domain command.  After processing the command, the server
   replies with a standard EPP response as defined in the EPP domain
   mapping.

4.  Formal Syntax

   An EPP object mapping is specified in XML Schema notation.  The
   formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation of
   the object mapping suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances.  The BEGIN and END tags are not part of the schema; they
   are used to note the beginning and ending of the schema for URI
   registration purposes.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].

   Registration request for the extension namespace:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:launch-1.0

   Registrant Contact: IESG

   XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the extension XML schema:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:launch-1.0

7.  Security Considerations

   The mapping extensions described in this document do not provide any
   security services beyond those described by EPP [RFC5730], the EPP
   domain name mapping [RFC5731], and protocol layers used by EPP.  The
   security considerations described in these other specifications apply
   to this specification as well.

   Updates to, and deletion of an application object must be restricted
   to clients authorized to perform the said operation on the object.

   As information contained within an application, or even the mere fact
   that an application exists may be confidential.  Any attempt to
   operate on an application object by an unauthorized client MUST be
   rejected with an EPP 2303 (object does not exist) or an appropriate
   auhorization error.  Server policy may allow <info> operation with
   filtered output by clients other than the sponsoring client, in which
   case the <domain:infData> and <launch:infData> response SHOULD be
   filtered to include only fields that are publicly accessible.
