    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
      extension mapping for the provisioning and management of domain name
      registrations and kapplications during the launch of a domain name registry.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
      <xref target="RFC5730">Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)</xref>.
      This EPP mapping specifies a flexible schema that can be used to
      implement several common use cases related to the provisioning and
      management of domain name registrations and applications during the launch of a domain name registry.</t>

      <t>It is typical for domain registries to operate in special modes during
      their initial launch to facilitate allocation of domain names, often according
      to special rules. This document uses the term "launch phase" and the shorter form
      "launch" to refer to such a period.</t>

      <t>The <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref> is designed
      for the steady-state operation of a registry. During a launch period, the
      model in place may be different from what is defined in
      the <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref>. For example,
      registries often accept multiple applications for the same domain name during
      the "Sunrise" launch phase, referred to as a Launch Application.  A Launch
      Registration refers to a registration made during a launch phase when the
      server uses a "first-come, first-served" model.  Even in a "first-come,
      first-served" model, additional steps and information might be required, such as trademark information. In addition, the <eref
      target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lozano-tmch-func-spec">TMCH Functional Specification</eref> 
      defines a registry interface for the Trademark Claims or "claims" launch phase that
      includes support for presenting a Trademark Claims Notice to the
      Registrant. This document proposes an extension to the domain name
      extension in order to unambiguously manage the various launch phases
      known.</t>

      <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>XML is case sensitive. Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
        and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
        character case presented in order to develop a conforming
        implementation.</t>

        <t>"launch-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:launch-1.0". The XML namespace prefix "launch"
        is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ
        a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and
        output the XML documents.</t>
        <t>"signedMark-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:signedMark-1.0" that is defined in <xref target="draft-lozano-smd"/>. 
        The XML namespace prefix "smd"
        is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ
        a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and
        output the XML documents.</t>
        <t>"mark-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:mark-1.0" that is defined in <xref target="draft-lozano-smd"/>. 
        The XML namespace prefix "mark"
        is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ
        a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and
        output the XML documents.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="attrs" title="Object Attributes">
      <t>This extension adds additional elements to the <xref
      target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref>. Only those new elements
      are described here.</t>

      <section anchor="applicationID" title="Application Identifier">
        <t>Servers MAY allow multiple applications, referred to as a Launch Application, 
        of the same domain name during its launch phase operations. Upon receiving 
        a valid request to create a Launch Application, the server MUST create an application
        object corresponding to the request, assign an application identifier
        for the Launch Application, set the <xref target="RFC5731"/> pendingCreate status, 
        and return the application identifier to the client with the
        &lt;launch:applicationID&gt; element. In order to facilitate
        correlation, all subsequent launch operations on the Launch Application
        MUST be qualified by the previously assigned application identifier
        using the &lt;launch:applicationID&gt; element.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="phases" title="Launch Phases">
        <t>The server MAY support multiple launch phases sequentially or
        simultaneously. The &lt;launch:phase&gt; element MUST be included by
        the client to define the target launch phase of the command.  
        The server SHOULD validate the &lt;launch:phase&gt; element 
        against the active phase of the server for a create command, 
        and return an EPP error result code of 2004 if there is a mismatch.</t>

        <t>The following launch phase values are defined: <list
            style="hanging">
            <t hangText="sunrise">The phase during which trademark holders can submit
            registrations or applications with trademark information that can be
            validated by the server.</t>

            <t hangText="landrush">A post-Sunrise phase when non-trademark
            holders are allowed to register domain names with steps taken 
            to address a large volume of initial registrations.</t>

            <t hangText="claims">The Trademark Claims phase, as defined in the  
            <eref
      target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lozano-tmch-func-spec">TMCH Functional Specification</eref>, in which a 
            Claims Notice must be displayed to a prospective registrant of a domain
            name that matches trademarks.</t>
            
            <t hangText="open">A post-launch phase that is also referred to as
            "steady state". Servers MAY require additional trademark
            protection during this phase.</t>

            <t hangText="custom">A custom server launch phase that is defined
            using the "name" attribute.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>For extensibility, the &lt;launch:phase&gt; element includes an
        OPTIONAL "name" attribute that can define a sub-phase or the full name
        of the phase when the &lt;launch:phase&gt; element has the "custom"
        value.  For example, the "claims" launch phase could have two 
        sub-phases that include "landrush" and "open".</t>
        
        <t>Launch phases MAY overlap to support the "claims" launch phase, defined in the <eref
      target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lozano-tmch-func-spec">TMCH Functional Specification</eref>, and to support 
      a traditional "landrush" launch phase.  The overlap of the "claims" and "landrush" launch phases 
      SHOULD be handled by setting "claims" as the &lt;launch:phase&gt; value and setting 
      "landrush" as the sub-phase with the "name" attribute.  For example, the &lt;launch:phase&gt; 
      element SHOULD be &lt;launch:phase name="landrush"&gt;claims&lt;/launch:phase&gt;.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="statuses" title="Status Values">
        <t>A Launch Application or Launch Registration object MAY have a launch status value. The
        &lt;launch:status&gt; element is used to convey the launch status pertaining to
        the object, beyond what is specified in the object mapping.  A Launch Application or Launch Registration MUST set the <xref target="RFC5731"/> pendingCreate status if 
        a launch status is supported and the launch status is not one of the final statuses, including the "allocated" and "rejected" statuses.</t>  

        <t>The following status values are defined using the 
        required "s" attribute: <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="pendingValidation:">The initial state of a newly-created
            application or registration object. The application or registration requires validation,
            but the validation process has not yet completed.</t>

            <t hangText="validated:">The application or registration meets relevant registry
            rules.</t>

            <t hangText="invalid:">The application or registration does not validate according
            to registry rules.</t>

            <t hangText="pendingAllocation:">The allocation of the application or registration 
            is pending based on the results of some out-of-band process (for example,
            an auction).</t>

            <t hangText="allocated:">One of two possible end states of an
            application or registration object; the object corresponding to the application or registration 
            has been provisioned.</t>

            <t hangText="rejected:">The other possible end state; the application or registration object
            was not provisioned.</t>

            <t hangText="custom:">A custom status that is defined using the 
            "name" attribute.</t>
          </list></t>

       <t>Each status value MAY be accompanied by a string of human-readable 
        text that describes the rationale for the status applied to the object.
        The OPTIONAL "lang" attribute MAY be present to identify the language 
        if the negotiated value is something other than the default value of 
        "en" (English).</t>
        
        <t>For extensibility the &lt;launch:status&gt; element includes an
        OPTIONAL "name" attribute that can define a sub-status or the full name
        of the status when the status value is "custom".  The server SHOULD 
        NOT use the "custom" status value.</t>

        <t>Certain status values MAY be combined. For example, an application or registration 
        may be both "invalid" and "rejected". Additionally, certain statuses MAY be
        skipped. For example, an application or registration MAY immediately start at the
        "allocated" status or an application or registration MAY skip the "pendingAllocation" status. 
        If the launch phase does
        not require validation of a request, an application or registration MAY immediately skip to
        "pendingAllocation". If the &lt;domain:create&gt;
        command processes a request synchronously without the use of an intermediate 
        application, then an <xref target="applicationID">Application
        Identifier</xref> MAY not be needed along with the application status.</t>

      Phase Extension.</t>

      <t>This mapping is designed to be flexible, requiring only a minimum set
      of required elements.</t>

      <t>While it is meant to serve several use cases, it does not prescribe
      any interpretation by the client or server. Such processing is typically
      highly policy-dependent and therefore specific to implementations.</t>

      <t>Operations on application objects are done via one or more of the
      existing EPP verbs defined in the <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name

       and with the value of "avail" for the <xref target="availCheckForm">Availability Check Form</xref>.  
       The default value of the "type" attribute is "claims".  The check forms supported is up to server policy.  
       The server MUST return an EPP error result code of 2307 
       if it receives a check form that is not supported.</t>  
       
       <section anchor="claimsCheckForm" title="Claims Check Form">

        <t>
        The Claims Check Form defines 
        a new command called the Claims Check Command 
        that is used to determine whether or not there are any matching 
        trademarks, in the specified launch phase, for each domain name passed in the command.  
        The availability check information defined in the <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name

        <t>Instead of 
        returning whether the domain name is available, the Claims Check Command will return whether 
        or not at least one matching trademark exists for the domain name.  
        If there is at least one matching trademark that exists for the 
        domain name, a &lt;launch:claimKey&gt; element is returned.  
        The client may then use the value of the &lt;launch:claimKey&gt; element
        to obtain information needed to generate the trademark Claims Notice from
        a third-party trademark validator such as
        the Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH).  The third party trademark 
        validator should also return a unique notice identifier  
        that can be passed in the &lt;launch:noticeID&gt; element of the extension to the
