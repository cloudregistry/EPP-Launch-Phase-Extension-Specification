    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
      extension mapping for the provisioning and management of domain names
      during the launch phase of a domain name registry.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
      <xref target="RFC5730">Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)</xref>.
      This EPP mapping specifies a flexible schema that can be used to
      implement several common use cases related to the provisioning and
      management of launch phase extension in a domain name registry.</t>

      <t>It is typical for domain registries to operate in special modes
      within certain periods of time to facilitate allocation of domain names
      for a subset of the zone namespace that becomes available. This document
      uses the term "launch phase" and the shorter form "launch" to refer to
      such a period.</t>

      <t>The <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref> is designed
      for the steady state operation of a registry. During the launch, the
      interface used at each phase of the launch could be different from what
      is defined in <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref>. for
      example, registries typically accept multiple applications for a given
      domain name during the "sunrise" launch phase. In addition, the <eref
      target="http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tmch-tech/attachments/20120629/92b95395/TMCH-Model-28jun2012-clean-0001.pdf">Trademark
      Clearinghouse Draft Implementation Model</eref> defines a registry
      interface for the Trademark Claims or "claims" launch phase that
      includes support for presenting a Trademark Claims Notice to the
      Registrant. This document proposes an extension to the domain name
      extension in order to unambiguously manage the various launch phases
      known.</t>

      <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>XML is case sensitive. Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
        and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
        character case presented in order to develop a conforming
        implementation.</t>

        <t>"launch-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:launch-1.0". The XML namespace prefix "launch"
        is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ
        a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and
        output the XML documents.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="attrs" title="Object Attributes">
      <t>This extension adds additional elements to the <xref
      target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref>. Only those new elements
      are described here.</t>

      <section anchor="applicationID" title="Application Identifiers">
        <t>Servers MAY allow multiple applications of a given domain name
        during its launch phase operations. Upon receiving a request to create
        a domain name, the server creates an application object corresponding
        to the request and assigns an application identifier for the application
        and returns it to the client with the &lt;launch:applicationID&gt;
        element. In order to facilitate correlation, all subsequent launch
        operations on the application object MUST be qualified by the
        previously assigned application identifier using the
        &lt;launch:applicationID&gt; element.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="phases" title="Launch Phases">
        <t>The server MAY support multiple launch phases sequentially or
        simultaneously. The &lt;launch:phase&gt; element MUST be included by
        the client to define the target launch phase of the command.</t>

        <t>The following launch phase values are defined: <list
            style="hanging">
            <t hangText="sunrise">Phase when trademark holders can submit
            registration applications with trademark information that can be
            validated by the server.</t>

            <t hangText="landrush">Post sunrise phase when non-trademark
            holders are allowed to register domain names.</t>

            <t hangText="claims">Trademark claims phase as defined by <eref
            target="http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tmch-tech/attachments/20120629/92b95395/TMCH-Model-28jun2012-clean-0001.pdf">Trademark
            Clearinghouse Draft Implementation Model</eref>.</t>

            <t hangText="open">Post launch phase that is also referred to as
            "steady state". Servers might require additional trademark
            protection with this phase.</t>

            <t hangText="custom">A custom server launch phase that is defined
            using the "name" attribute.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>For extensibility the &lt;launch:phase&gt; element includes an
        OPTIONAL "name" attribute that can define a sub-phase or the full name
        of the phase when the &lt;launch:phase&gt; element has the "custom"
        value.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="statuses" title="Status Values">
        <t>A launch application object MAY have a status value. The
        &lt;status&gt; element is used to convey extended status pertaining to
        the application object, beyond what is specified in the object mapping
        to which this application object represents.</t>

        <t>The following status values are defined: <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="pending:">the initial state of a newly-created
            application object.</t>

            <t hangText="validated:">the application meets relevant registry
            rules.</t>

            <t hangText="invalid:">the application does not validate according
            to registry rules</t>

            <t hangText="allocated:">one of two possible end states of an
            application object; the object corresponding to the application
            has been provisioned</t>

            <t hangText="rejected:">the other possible end state; the object
            was not provisioned</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Certain status values MAY be combined. For example, an application
        can be invalid and rejected. Additionally certain statuses MAY be
        skipped. For example, an application can immediately start at the
        allocated status. If a &lt;domain:create&gt; processes a request
        synchronously without the use of an intermediate application, than an
        <xref target="applicationID">Application Identifier</xref> is not
        needed along with the application status.</t>

      <t>This mapping is designed to be flexible, requiring only a minimum set
      of required elements.</t>

      <t>While it is meant to serve several use cases, it does not prescribe
      any interpretation by the client or server. Such processing is typically
      highly policy-dependent and therefore specific to implementations.</t>

      <t>Operations on application objects are done via one or more of the
      existing EPP verbs defined in the <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name
      mapping</xref>. Registries may choose to support a subset of the
      operations.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
