    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
      extension mapping for the provisioning and management of domain names
      during the launch phase of a domain name registry.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
      <xref target="RFC5730">Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)</xref>.
      This EPP mapping specifies a flexible schema that can be used to
      implement several common use cases related to the provisioning and
      management of launch phase extension in a domain name registry.</t>

      <t>It is typical for domain registries to operate in special modes
      within certain periods of time to facilitate allocation of domain names. 
      This document
      uses the term "launch phase" and the shorter form "launch" to refer to
      such a period.</t>

      <t>The <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref> is designed
      for the steady state operation of a registry. During the launch, the
      interface used at each phase of the launch could be different from what
      is defined in <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref>. for
      example, registries typically accept multiple applications for a given
      domain name during the "sunrise" launch phase, referred to as a launch application.  A launch registration 
      is used to refer to a registration made during a launch phase when the server uses 
      a first-come-first-serve model.  Even in a first-come-first-serve model additional steps 
      and information might be required to support a launch phase, like the passing of 
      trademark information on a create.  In addition, the <eref
      target="http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/about/trademark-clearinghouse/claims-model-26sep12-en.pdf">Proposed Trademark Claims Model</eref> 
      defines a registry
      interface for the Trademark Claims or "claims" launch phase that
      includes support for presenting a Trademark Claims Notice to the
      Registrant. This document proposes an extension to the domain name
      extension in order to unambiguously manage the various launch phases
      known.</t>

      <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>XML is case sensitive. Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
        and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
        character case presented in order to develop a conforming
        implementation.</t>

        <t>"launch-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:launch-1.0". The XML namespace prefix "launch"
        is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ
        a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and
        output the XML documents.</t>
        <t>"signedMark-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:signedMark-1.0". The XML namespace prefix "smd"
        is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ
        a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and
        output the XML documents.</t>
        <t>"mark-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:mark-1.0". The XML namespace prefix "mark"
        is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ
        a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and
        output the XML documents.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="attrs" title="Object Attributes">
      <t>This extension adds additional elements to the <xref
      target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref>. Only those new elements
      are described here.</t>

      <section anchor="applicationID" title="Application Identifiers">
        <t>Servers MAY allow multiple applications, referred to as a launch application, 
        of a given domain name
        during its launch phase operations. Upon receiving a request to create
        a domain name, the server creates an application object corresponding
        to the request and assigns an application identifier for the application
        and returns it to the client with the &lt;launch:applicationID&gt;
        element. In order to facilitate correlation, all subsequent launch
        operations on the application object MUST be qualified by the
        previously assigned application identifier using the
        &lt;launch:applicationID&gt; element.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="phases" title="Launch Phases">
        <t>The server MAY support multiple launch phases sequentially or
        simultaneously. The &lt;launch:phase&gt; element MUST be included by
        the client to define the target launch phase of the command.</t>

        <t>The following launch phase values are defined: <list
            style="hanging">
            <t hangText="sunrise">Phase when trademark holders can submit
            registrations or applications with trademark information that can be
            validated by the server.</t>

            <t hangText="landrush">Post sunrise phase when non-trademark
            holders are allowed to register domain names with steps taken 
            to address a large volume of initial registrations.</t>

            <t hangText="claims1">Trademark claims phase 1 as defined by 
            Trademark Clearinghouse model of displaying a full, detailed 
            claims notice to clients for domain names that match 
            trademarks.</t>
            
            <t hangText="claims2">Trademark claims phase 2 as defined by 
            Trademark Clearinghouse model of displaying a short, educational 
            claims notice to clients for domain names that match 
            trademarks that opt into the service.</t>

            <t hangText="open">Post launch phase that is also referred to as
            "steady state". Servers MAY require additional trademark
            protection with this phase.</t>

            <t hangText="custom">A custom server launch phase that is defined
            using the "name" attribute.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>For extensibility the &lt;launch:phase&gt; element includes an
        OPTIONAL "name" attribute that can define a sub-phase or the full name
        of the phase when the &lt;launch:phase&gt; element has the "custom"
        value.  For example, the "claims1" launch phase could have two 
        sub-phases that include "landrush" and "open".</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="statuses" title="Status Values">
        <t>A launch application object MAY have a status value. The
        &lt;launch:status&gt; element is used to convey extended status pertaining to
        the application object, beyond what is specified in the object mapping
        for this application object.</t>

        <t>The following status values are defined using the 
        required "s" attribute: <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="pending:">The initial state of a newly-created
            application object.</t>

            <t hangText="validated:">The application meets relevant registry
            rules.</t>

            <t hangText="invalid:">The application does not validate according
            to registry rules.</t>

            <t hangText="pendingAuction:">The application is pending based on 
            results of an auction.</t>

            <t hangText="allocated:">One of two possible end states of an
            application object; the object corresponding to the application
            has been provisioned.</t>

            <t hangText="rejected:">The other possible end state; the object
            was not provisioned.</t>

            <t hangText="custom:">A custom status that is defined using the 
            "name" attribute.</t>
          </list></t>

       <t>Each status value MAY be accompanied by a string of human-readable 
        text that describes the rationale for the status applied to the object.
        The OPTIONAL "lang" attribute MAY be present to identify the language 
        if the negotiated value is something other than the default value of 
        "en" (English).</t>
        
        <t>For extensibility the &lt;launch:status&gt; element includes an
        OPTIONAL "name" attribute that can define a sub-status or the full name
        of the status when the status value is "custom".  The server SHOULD 
        NOT use the "custom" status value.</t>

        <t>Certain status values MAY be combined. For example, an application
        can be invalid and rejected. Additionally certain statuses MAY be
        skipped. For example, an application MAY immediately start at the
        allocated status or an application MAY skip the pendingAuction status
        if the server does not support an auction. If a &lt;domain:create&gt; processes a request
        synchronously without the use of an intermediate application, than an
        <xref target="applicationID">Application Identifier</xref> is not
        needed along with the application status.</t>

    <section anchor="commands" title="EPP Command Mapping">
      <t>A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
      in the EPP core protocol specification <xref target="RFC5730"/>. The
      command mappings described here are specifically for use in the Launch
      Phase Extension.</t>

      <t>This mapping is designed to be flexible, requiring only a minimum set
      of required elements.</t>

      <t>While it is meant to serve several use cases, it does not prescribe
      any interpretation by the client or server. Such processing is typically
      highly policy-dependent and therefore specific to implementations.</t>

      <t>Operations on application objects are done via one or more of the
      existing EPP verbs defined in the <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name
      mapping</xref>. Registries may choose to support a subset of the
      operations.</t>

      <section anchor="checkCommand" title="EPP &lt;check&gt; Command">
        <t>This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP
        &lt;check&gt; command and response to be used in conjunction with the
        <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref>.</t>
        
        <t>This extension defines a new command called the Claims Check Command 
        that is used to determine whether or not there are any matching 
        trademarks, in the specified launch phase, for each domain name passed in the command.  
        The availability check information defined in the <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name
      mapping</xref> MUST NOT be returned for the Claims Check Command.  
        Instead of 
        returning whether the domain name is available the Claims Check Command will return whether 
        or not at least one matching trademark exists for the domain name.  
        If there is at least one matching trademark that exists for the 
        domain name a &lt;launch:claimKey&gt; element is returned.  
        The value of the &lt;launch:claimKey&gt; element can 
        be used with an info service of a third party trademark provider like 
        the Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH) for getting the information needed 
        to generate the trademark claims notice.  The third party trademark 
        provider should also return a unique notice identifier  
        that can be passed in the &lt;launch:noticeID&gt; element of the extension to the 
        <xref target="createCommand">Create Command</xref>.
        
        The &lt;domain:name&gt; elements in the EPP &lt;check&gt; 
        command of <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref> define 
        the domain names to check for matching trademarks.  
        The &lt;launch:check&gt; element contains the following child elements:</t>

          <t><list hangIndent="4" style="hanging">
