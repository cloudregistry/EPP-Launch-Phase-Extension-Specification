    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
      extension mapping for the provisioning and management of domain name
      applications during the launch of a domain name registry.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
      <xref target="RFC5730">Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)</xref>.
      This EPP mapping specifies a flexible schema that can be used to
      implement several common use cases related to the provisioning and
      management of domain name applications during the launch of a domain name registry.</t>

      <t>It is typical for domain registries to operate in special modes during
      their initial launch to facilitate allocation of domain names, often according
      to special rules. This document uses the term "launch phase" and the shorter form
      "launch" to refer to such a period.</t>

      <t>The <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref> is designed
      for the steady-state operation of a registry. During a launch period, the
      model in place may be different from what is defined in
      <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref>. For example,
      registries often accept multiple applications for the same domain name during
      the "Sunrise" launch phase, referred to as a Launch Application.  A Launch
      Registration refers to a registration made during a launch phase when the
      server uses a "first-come, first-served" model.  Even in a "first-come,
      first-served" model, additional steps and information might be required to
      support an application, such as trademark information. In addition, the <eref
      target="http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/about/trademark-clearinghouse/claims-model-26sep12-en.pdf">Proposed Trademark Claims Model</eref> 
      defines a registry interface for the Trademark Claims or "claims" launch phase that
      includes support for presenting a Trademark Claims Notice to the
      Registrant. This document proposes an extension to the domain name
      extension in order to unambiguously manage the various launch phases
      known.</t>

      <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>XML is case sensitive. Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
        and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
        character case presented in order to develop a conforming
        implementation.</t>

        <t>"launch-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:launch-1.0". The XML namespace prefix "launch"
        is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ
        a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and
        output the XML documents.</t>
        <t>"signedMark-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:signedMark-1.0" that is defined in <xref target="draft-lozano-smd"/>. 
        The XML namespace prefix "smd"
        is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ
        a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and
        output the XML documents.</t>
        <t>"mark-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:mark-1.0" that is defined in <xref target="draft-lozano-smd"/>. 
        The XML namespace prefix "mark"
        is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ
        a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and
        output the XML documents.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="attrs" title="Object Attributes">
      <t>This extension adds additional elements to the <xref
      target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref>. Only those new elements
      are described here.</t>

      <section anchor="applicationID" title="Application Identifiers">
        <t>Servers MAY allow multiple applications, referred to as a Launch Application, 
        of the same domain name during its launch phase operations. Upon receiving 
        a request to create a domain name, the server creates an application
        object corresponding to the request, assigns an application identifier
        for the application, and returns it to the client with the
        &lt;launch:applicationID&gt; element. In order to facilitate
        correlation, all subsequent launch operations on the application object
        MUST be qualified by the previously assigned application identifier
        using the &lt;launch:applicationID&gt; element.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="phases" title="Launch Phases">
        <t>The server MAY support multiple launch phases sequentially or
        simultaneously. The &lt;launch:phase&gt; element MUST be included by
        the client to define the target launch phase of the command.</t>

        <t>The following launch phase values are defined: <list
            style="hanging">
            <t hangText="sunrise">The phase during which trademark holders can submit
            registrations or applications with trademark information that can be
            validated by the server.</t>

            <t hangText="landrush">A post-Sunrise phase when non-trademark
            holders are allowed to register domain names with steps taken 
            to address a large volume of initial registrations.</t>

            <t hangText="claims1">The Trademark Claims Phase 1, as defined by 
            Trademark Clearinghouse model, in which a full, detailed 
            Claims Notice must be displayed to prospective registrants of domain
            names that match trademarks.</t>
            
            <t hangText="claims2">The Trademark Claims Phase 2, as defined by 
            Trademark Clearinghouse model, in which a short, educational 
            Claims Notice must be displayed to prospective registrants of domain
            names that match trademarks that have opted in.</t>

            <t hangText="open">A post-launch phase that is also referred to as
            "steady state". Servers MAY require additional trademark
            protection during this phase.</t>

            <t hangText="custom">A custom server launch phase that is defined
            using the "name" attribute.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>For extensibility, the &lt;launch:phase&gt; element includes an
        OPTIONAL "name" attribute that can define a sub-phase or the full name
        of the phase when the &lt;launch:phase&gt; element has the "custom"
        value.  For example, the "claims1" launch phase could have two 
        sub-phases that include "landrush" and "open".</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="statuses" title="Status Values">
        <t>A Launch Application object MAY have a status value. The
        &lt;launch:status&gt; element is used to convey extended status pertaining to
        the application object, beyond what is specified in the object mapping
        for this application object.</t>

        <t>The following status values are defined using the 
        required "s" attribute: <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="pendingValidation:">The initial state of a newly-created
            application object. The application requires validation,
            but the validation process has not yet completed.</t>

            <t hangText="validated:">The application meets relevant registry
            rules.</t>

            <t hangText="invalid:">The application does not validate according
            to registry rules.</t>

            <t hangText="pendingAllocation:">The allocation of the application
            is pending based on the results of some out-of-band process (for example,
            an auction).</t>

            <t hangText="allocated:">One of two possible end states of an
            application object; the object corresponding to the application
            has been provisioned.</t>

            <t hangText="rejected:">The other possible end state; the object
            was not provisioned.</t>

            <t hangText="custom:">A custom status that is defined using the 
            "name" attribute.</t>
          </list></t>

       <t>Each status value MAY be accompanied by a string of human-readable 
        text that describes the rationale for the status applied to the object.
        The OPTIONAL "lang" attribute MAY be present to identify the language 
        if the negotiated value is something other than the default value of 
        "en" (English).</t>
        
        <t>For extensibility the &lt;launch:status&gt; element includes an
        OPTIONAL "name" attribute that can define a sub-status or the full name
        of the status when the status value is "custom".  The server SHOULD 
        NOT use the "custom" status value.</t>

        <t>Certain status values MAY be combined. For example, an application
        may be both invalid and rejected. Additionally, certain statuses MAY be
        skipped. For example, an application MAY immediately start at the
        "allocated" status or an application MAY skip the "pendingAllocation" status
        if the server uses a "first-come, first served" model. If the launch phase does
        not require validation of a request, an application MAY immediately skip to
        "pendingAllocation". If the &lt;domain:create&gt;
        command processes a request synchronously without the use of an intermediate,
        application, then an <xref target="applicationID">Application
        Identifier</xref> is not needed along with the application status.</t>

      command mappings described here are specifically for use in the Launch
      Phase Extension.</t>

      <t>This mapping is designed to be flexible, requiring only a minimum set
      of required elements.</t>

      <t>While it is meant to serve several use cases, it does not prescribe
      any interpretation by the client or server. Such processing is typically
      highly policy-dependent and therefore specific to implementations.</t>

      <t>Operations on application objects are done via one or more of the
      existing EPP verbs defined in the <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name
      mapping</xref>. Registries may choose to support a subset of the
      operations.</t>

      <section anchor="checkCommand" title="EPP &lt;check&gt; Command">
        <t>This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP
        &lt;check&gt; command and response to be used in conjunction with the
        <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref>.</t>
        
        <t>This extension defines a new command called the Claims Check Command 
        that is used to determine whether or not there are any matching 
        trademarks, in the specified launch phase, for each domain name passed in the command.  
        The availability check information defined in the <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name
      mapping</xref> MUST NOT be returned for the Claims Check Command.</t>  
        <t>Instead of 
        returning whether the domain name is available, the Claims Check Command will return whether 
        or not at least one matching trademark exists for the domain name.  
        If there is at least one matching trademark that exists for the 
        domain name, a &lt;launch:claimKey&gt; element is returned.  
        The client may then use the value of the &lt;launch:claimKey&gt; element
        to obtain information needed to generate the trademark Claims Notice from
        a third-party trademark validator such as
        the Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH).  The third party trademark 
        validator should also return a unique notice identifier  
        that can be passed in the &lt;launch:noticeID&gt; element of the extension to the 
        <xref target="createCommand">Create Command</xref>.</t>
        
        <t>The &lt;domain:name&gt; elements in the EPP &lt;check&gt; 
        command of <xref target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref> define 
        the domain names to check for matching trademarks.

              "claims1" or "claims2" to indicate that the command is a Claims Check Command.
              The "claims1" Claims Check Command will match the &lt;domain:name&gt;
              against the full list of trademark labels. The "claims2" 
              Claims Check Command will match the &lt;domain:name&gt; against

        <t>This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP
        &lt;delete&gt; command to be used in conjunction with the domain name
        mapping.</t>

        <t>A server that does not support multiple applications of a
        given domain name with an <xref target="applicationID">Application
        Identifier</xref> during its launch phase operations MUST return an
        EPP error result code of 2102.</t>

        <t>Registry policies permitting, clients MAY withdraw an application
        by submitting an EPP &lt;delete&gt; command along with a
        &lt;launch:delete&gt; element to indicate the application object to be
        deleted. The &lt;launch:delete&gt; element contains the following
        child elements:</t>
        <t><list hangIndent="4" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="&lt;launch:phase&gt;">The phase during which the
            application was submitted or is associated with.</t>

            <t hangText="&lt;launch:applicationID&gt;">The application
            identifier for which the client wishes to delete.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This extension does not define any extension to the response of a
        &lt;delete&gt; domain command. After processing the command, the
        server replies with a standard EPP response as defined in the <xref
        target="RFC5731">EPP domain name mapping</xref>.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
